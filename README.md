# MiceLab

Java, Spring, Hibernate

MiceLab is my final project of the bootcamp at the Coders Lab school. This application is inspired by the needs of scientists who match mice with selected genotype for future experiments. 

Features:
- managing the population: adding mice, editing mice 
- finding matches due to selected criteria 
- monitoring the mice population 

Plans for future:
- sending E-mails about necessary manual changes  
- adding security authorization
